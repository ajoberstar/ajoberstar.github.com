I heard about [If This Then That](http://ifttt.com) on [Tech News Today](http://twit.tv/tnt) a couple weeks ago and just started playing around with it today.  It's basically a way for you to automate all kinds of tasks based on different web services (mostly social networks) that you use.  Some examples:

- Post all new blog posts (RSS entries) to Twitter.
- Add all Last.fm scrobbles in new rows in a Google Drive spreadsheet.
- Save any Youtube videos I mark as "watch later" to Pocket.
- Email me if it's going to rain tomorrow.

I like the idea and hope they can expand it to even more services.
